# Flappy-Bird-Game
I have developed a Flappy Bird game using **Assembly language**, demonstrating mastery over low-level programming and hardware interaction. The game features smooth controls, obstacle generation, and dynamic scoringâ€”all optimized for performance. Proud to showcase my skills in building efficient, resource-conscious applications from the ground up! #GameDev #AssemblyLanguage #ProblemSolving
